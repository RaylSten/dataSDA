# dataSDA: Data Sets for Symbolic Data Analysis in R

Symbolic data analysis (SDA) is an extension of standard data analysis where symbolic data tables are used as input and symbolic objects are made output as a result. The data units are called symbolic since they are more complex than standard ones, as they not only contain values or categories, but also include internal variation and structure.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a><a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
